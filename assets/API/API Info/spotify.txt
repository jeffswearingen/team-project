Spotify API
Very well written and easy to use.  I don’t believe we will be able to use this with the concept of our web app.  The web API allows you to show search results for artists, tracks, etc. but doesn’t allow you to interact with those tracks on your site (play/pause/listen).  


You can easily add a Spotify widget with an artist or playlist set to it but that is all HTML not what we are looking for.  If we had a concept allowing users to log into their account and organize their music in an efficient way or select a playlist they created to pull videos associated with those acts from the yotube API it would make sense (Morgans group is doing something like that).  But also pointless because I believe Spotify and most other streaming apps now offer videos.
